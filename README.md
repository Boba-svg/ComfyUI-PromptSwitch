![Sample image](images/sample.png)

### 1. Ultra-Intuitive! Interactive Prompt Management

When the node is not in edit mode, each line of the prompt is displayed like a "checklist."

* **‚ö°Ô∏è [Original] Toggle ON/OFF (Activate/Comment Out) Lines** üü¢/‚ö´
    * Simply **click** a text line within the node to instantly enable/disable that prompt. Trial and error becomes super smooth!
* **‚ö°Ô∏è [Original] Easy Fine-Tuning of Prompt Weights** ‚öñÔ∏è
    * Click the **\`[+]\` / \`[-]\` buttons** to the right of each line to quickly increase or decrease the weight by **\`CONFIG.WEIGHT_STEP\` (default 0.10)**. The weight value is displayed next to the buttons.
* **‚ö°Ô∏è [Original] Features remain active in Edit Mode** ‚úèÔ∏è
    * It continues to function as a normal prompt input node **even while in edit mode**. Seamlessly switch between editing and execution.
* **üÜï [Switch] Separator Line Drawn for Empty Lines** ‚úÖ
    * A thin horizontal line is automatically drawn for **empty lines** to enhance the visibility of prompt blocks (resolving a minor frustration from the original).
* **üÜï [Switch] Visually Optimized! Significant Display Improvement** üëÄ
    * **Automatic Text Abbreviation**: If a line is too long, it is automatically abbreviated to prevent the node's visual layout from breaking.
    * **Comment Readability Adjustment**: The following visual adjustments are made for commented-out lines (lines starting with \`//\`):
        * **The comment symbol \`//\` is hidden**.
        * The comment color and **font size are optimized** to make the main prompt stand out more prominently.

### 2. Node Mode Switching

* **‚úèÔ∏è Edit Mode**
    * Press **\`F2\`** or the **\`E\` key**, or **double-click the left, bottom, or right border of the node body** to toggle the display of the regular text input area.
* **üÜï [Switch] Minimum Mode (Visible/Invisible)**
    * Press the **\`V\` key** to toggle the display of the selected node!
        * **Normal Mode (Expanded)**: All lines are displayed, allowing you to focus on prompt editing.
        * **Compact Mode (Minimized)**: Invalid lines are hidden to minimize the node height. Useful for maximizing canvas space!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è [Original] Powerful Versatility through Text Editor Prompt Management

Prompt Palette's text editor feature brings powerful versatility to prompt editing. Here are a few examples:

### 1. Ease of Importing Prompts Created by Others

After copying a prompt, replace the "commas" with "comma + newline characters" in a separate editor and paste it into this node. **All elements are immediately listed**.

### 2. Usage Method Utilizing Prompt Introduction Sites + Chat AI

By utilizing prompt introduction sites and chat AI, you can easily obtain a powerful prompt list and save the trouble of re-searching.

1.  First, type the following instruction into the Chat AI input screen (don't press Enter yet):
    \`\`\`
    Please extract the prompts and their corresponding comments from the following text in the format "prompt // comment". Group them so that a blank line separates categories, and the entire list can be copied with a single copy button.
    \`\`\`
2.  Then, copy the content from the prompt introduction site with \`Ctrl + A\` $\rightarrow$ \`Ctrl + C\`, paste it after the instruction above, and press Enter.
3.  The Chat AI will likely list the prompts from that page in the "prompt // comment" format and even provide a copy button.
4.  Paste that into PromptSwitch, and you will **immediately obtain a powerful prompt list**, saving you the effort of searching the prompt introduction site every time you forget a detail.

## üí° Update History
1.  25/10/16 Public release
2.  25/10/17 **Added Exclusion via Trailing Tags**: Added a feature to exclude specific nodes from batch operations (\`Shift+A\` (\`/a\`) / \`Shift+V\` (\`/v\`)). Exclusion via leading tags like \`‚Äª\` or \`-\` in the node title was removed for simplification.
3.  25/10/20 Fixed an issue where weight notation remained in the actual data when weights were reset.
4.  25/10/20 Unified weight operation behavior for both comma-separated and non-comma-separated patterns.
5.  25/10/20 Removed all flag-related processing for controlling feature ON/OFF states.
6.  25/10/30 **Changed R Key to Random Pickup**: Introduced random pickup for the selected node with the single R key, and batch random pickup for all nodes with \`Shift+R\`. The existing weight reset function was moved to the **W key**.
7.  25/10/30 **Added Random Pickup Expansion Feature**: The number of elements to randomly activate can now be specified as a range or a fixed number by appending the \`/R[number]\` tag to the node title.

***

## üí° Next Planned Updates
1.  Do not include newline characters in the prompt if a line is just a blank line.
2.  Introduce a mode that does not include newlines between concatenated prompts or at the end of the final prompt $\rightarrow$ for users who prefer clean output (The current visibility is preferred by the developer).
3.  Introduce \`Shift+E\` to open all nodes in edit mode $\rightarrow$ for enabling browser search functionality.
4.  Fix a bug where the random function defaults to non-operation if multiple trailing tags are present.
